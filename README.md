# Databases

This repository contains SQL database projects I have created.

## Soccer [(FirstProject-Soccer)](/FirstProject-Soccer/)

The purpose of this database is to use data from soccer games in five different European countries to learn the basics of constructing SQL queries to find out important and interesting facts.

All of the SQL queries: [soccer_queries.sql](/FirstProject-Soccer/soccer_queries.sql). There are descriptions of each query above them.

There are five tables (countries), with around 290k rows of data in total. Data gotten from: https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata/tree/master/data-raw
