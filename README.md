# Databases

This repository contains SQL database projects I have created.

## Soccer [(FirstProject-Soccer)](/FirstProject-Soccer/)

The purpose of this database is to use data from soccer games in five different European countries to learn the basics of constructing SQL queries to find out important and interesting facts. This is my first database project, so it serves as a good learning experience.

All of the SQL queries: [soccer_queries.sql](/FirstProject-Soccer/soccer_queries.sql)

There are five tables (countries), with the attributes mainly being: date of game, season, teams playing, score, etc.
